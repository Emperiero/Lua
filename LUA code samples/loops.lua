--[[ in LUA you have loops, just like every other language to exist
you have your conditional loops --]]

for loops
-- executes a sequence of statements multiple times, or abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable 


while loops
-- repeats a statement or group of statements while already given a condition 
-- it will test the condition BEFORE executing itself

repeat until loop 
--repeats the operation of group of statemens till a condition is met

nested loop
-- you can use one or more loop inside of any other loop

break 
-- breaks or terminates the loop

example below 

while ( true )
do
    print("this loop is going to run forever")
end
