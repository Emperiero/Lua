--[[ this is a decently sized part of lua
these are your math operators/operators in general --]] 

+ 
-- addition 

- 
-- subtraction 

*
-- multiplication 

/ 
-- divide 

-- these are your BASIC operators you can look more abt operators simply on the internet 

-- here are your relational operators
-- so lets just assume the value of x is 10 and the value of y is 20 

== 
-- checks if the value of multiple numbers are equal or not if yes then the condition is true

~= 
-- checks if the value of two numbers are equal or not, if the are NOT equal, the condition becomes true

> 
-- this one is self explanatory 

< 
-- same with this one

>= 
--[[ checks if the value of the left number is greater or equal to the value on the right 
if yes, then the condition becomes true --]]

<= 
-- same thing with the last one JUST the opposite 

logical operators 

and 
-- if both of the numbers are a non zero then the condition becomes true

or 
-- checks if any of the two numbers is a non zero, if so the condition is true

not 
-- checks if the logical state of its numbers if a condition is true, then the the logical NOT operator will make it false
