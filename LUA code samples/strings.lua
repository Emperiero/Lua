-- this is going to be all about strings in lua, this is a pretty simple concept until you get to arrays so

string1 = "hello"
print("\"String 1\"",string1)

-- second way to do strings is

string2 = 'hello'
print("String 2",string2)

-- and last way is 

string3 = [["Hello!!"]]
print("String 3 ",string3)

-- now again this is a simple explanation of strings in LUA to learn more i would suggest reading at "https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/lua_strings.htm"
