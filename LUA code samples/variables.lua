--[[ this is going to be focused on variables, very simple concept
but super important to understand when programming in any language lol --]]

-- in lua theres lots of different ways of doing variables

-- variable def

local x, y 

-- assign 

x = 10
y = 20

-- printing the variable

print("the value of x is: ", x)
print("the value of y is: ", y)


--[[ this is going to print out the number the variable is assigned too
so it will end up looking like this --]]

the value of x is: 10
the value ox y is: 20

-- pretty simple concept right?
