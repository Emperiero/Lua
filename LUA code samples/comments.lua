-- making a comment in lua is simple, as you can see...

--just type "--" and then what you need to comment.

-- to write a comment with multiple lines, youll need to do "--[[ --]]"

-- so that will look like this

--[[ this 
is
a
multi
line
comment
in
lua --]]

-- note: the end to the comment doesnt have to be on the same line :)
